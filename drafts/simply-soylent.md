# The Solent Solution

People have been drawn to the idea of meal replacements for a long time.  Who among us can resist the idea of not having to cook, or shop for food, or spend time eating with annoying lunch mates?

Especially dieters perplexed and puzzled by instructions to *cook at home* and *drink water when hungry*, the idea of being able to simply consume a shake or pre-prepared meal has been irresistible.

But for most of us the use of meal replacements has been a failure?  Why?

### Too Expensive

Just as a personal trainer is the best way to get in shape but is far too expensive for most people, until now meal replacements have cost far more than even *good* food at the supermarket and nearly as much as eating out every night.  Faced with the fiduciary responsibility of the home budget, most of us chose either to actually save money and cook home or to say to hell with it and eat out regularly.  Both options seem preferable to eating boring meal replacements at twice the cost.

### Too Boring

Lets face it.  Eating is a great hobby.  Its fun, it feels good and its something to do with our friends and dates.  If you are done eating after only a few minutes of drinking a shake, it isn’t exactly social.

### Too Weird

Beyond the social aspects, we define ourselves by what and where and with whom we eat.  Meal replacements take all that away and for most it simply isn’t worth it.
