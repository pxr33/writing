#Tiny Habits

Change is hard.

We are, each of us, a series of triggers and habits that play out predictably.  The inevitability of the results that are coming for us can be a little discouraging.  After all, we cry, if we cannot change then what can we do?

[BJ Fogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8) says there are three things needed to be able to cause a behavior:

1) There has to be some level of motivation
2) You have to have the ability to do it
3) There has to be a trigger

Motivation and ability are trade-offs.  That is, if something is hard to do then you need a heck of a lot of motivation to get it done.  And if something is easy to do, you can do it even if you aren’t all that motivated.

In either case it’s the trigger that will set the behavior in motion.  If the task is too hard for your current motivation level, however, the trigger will fail.

Those of you who are computer programmers are probably starting to perk up.  This sounds like code.  This is *behavior as code*.

Fogg’s realization was that having a consistently high motivation was a recipe for failure so he went to the other end of the motivation/ability graph and chose behaviors that are really easy to do.  

That still left the problem of a reliable trigger.  He knew that since the task was so easy, he would likely do it in response to a trigger no matter how unmotivated he was.  But what trigger would get him to do it often enough?

He realized that the best trigger would be something that he already did habitually.  For example, “After I wake up I will do three push ups.”   “After I walk in the door I will hang my keys on the hook.”  These triggers are great because you are already doing them, so they are failsafe.

This sounds like a practical and realistic approach to building big habits from tiny ones.  I’m going to give it a try.
