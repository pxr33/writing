I love the new Apple Photos app in Yosemite. For me serious photo editing is done in Photohop and so Lightroom was just used for photo organization and import. 

Lightroom is great but I had to have a custom workflow to import my iPhone photos mixed in with my camera photos. And worse, all my photos were locked in my desktop computer never to beaten again. 

Photos fixes both of these problems. My iPhone photos are instantly in my main collection and my camera photos are available on my iPhone at all times.   iCloud storage is a bit expensive but I can live with that.  

The biggest downside: when you first import your collection into Photos do it gradually or be faced with an iCloud sync that will render your home network unusable for weeks. I made this mistake and my home wifi has been swamped. 

Photos offers an option to suspend uploading for 24 hours which I do every time I'm home and trying to use the Internet. Thanks Apple for including this option and having it auto re-enable since we would all forget otherwise. But no thanks for making the interval 24 hours which is silly. Why would I want to pause for exactly 24 hours?  I do sleep you know. Why not 12 or 8 hours?

The fact that this option exists at all tells me that Apple knows the uploads can take over your network. A more elegant solution would be for the uploads to adaptively adjust to network conditions just as Dropbox and Crashplan do.
